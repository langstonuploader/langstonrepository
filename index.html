	<h1>All about my dog Sophie</h1>
	<h2>The greatest dog of all dogs.</h2>
<body>
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Sophie is a German Shepherd and Terrier mix. She is 10 years old and I have had her since I was seven. She has brown and black hair and is relatively small in size. Sophie is calm most of the time but does get excited sometimes and she is very cute when excited. Sophie is protective of the family members and really nice when people she likes come over to our house. She is cautious of people at first but likes almost everyone she meets after being near them for a little bit. </p>
